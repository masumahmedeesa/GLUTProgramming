Suppose you are given a polygon consisting of 4 vertices A(x1, y1), B(x2, y2), C(x3, y3), D(x4, y4).
Draw the polygon and perform the four following tasks
1. Translate the polygon Where tx and ty are given
2. Rotate the polygon about z axis where angle is theta
3. Scale the polygon, where Sx and Sy are given
4. Create the mirror image of the polygon with respect to X and Y axis.

All the values should be taken as user input.
